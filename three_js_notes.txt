The core of three.js is focused on the most important components of a 3D engine. Many other components like loaders or controls are part of the examples directory. three.js ensures that these files are kept in sync with the core but users have to import them separately if they are required for a project. You can find in the examples/jsm directory an ES6 module version for almost all example files. If you install three.js via npm, you can import them like so:

import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
